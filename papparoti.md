### Let's get started

#### Start with the Dough 

1. Into the mixing bowl, add bread flour, and sugar, mix slightly with the __dough hook__. into 2 different sides of the bowl, add instant yeast and salt, mix until combined. 
1. Add milk and egg, and mix on medium speed until become one piece of dough. It can be sticky at first. 
1. After the dough become smooth, add in our butter and keep kneading until smooth, Test the dough by pulling it out, if it creates a thin film then it's good for the next step. 
1. Turn on the oven for 5 minutes at 180 degrees Celcius and turn it off. We only need the leftover heat for the dough to raise. 
1. Take the dough out of the bowl, knead and shape the dough into a smooth ball meanwhile oil the bowl to put the dough back in. Cover it with plastic film, poke a few holes. 
1. Put the dough into the warm oven with our bowl of hot water. Wait for the dough to double in size for about 40 to 60 minutes.
1. After 40-60' take out and deflate the dough, Spilt the dough into 10 balls (about 60g each). Shape the dough into a ball inside out and seal the end so that it won't puff out.
* The filling is optional at this step, you can add a small cold cube of butter inside the dough before you seal the end. This will allow the dough to be more buttery after being baked.
1. Put all the dough into your baking tray, evenly separated, cover with a damped cloth. Let the dough rest for about 40' or until they rise by half. 

#### Meanwhile, let's prepare the Topping

1. Mix the Instant coffee with hot water, allow to cool. 
1. Beat am egg into a bowl. 
1. Soften the butter, add icing sugar, and whisk. Slowly add the egg bowl while whisking. 
1. Add the coffee mix and whisk until combine. 
1. Add in the cake flour and cocos powder, mix well using a spatula until combine. 
1. Finally, add the mixture into a piping bag with a small tip. Let the topping rest in the fridge until use. 



After the dough rises by half, pipe the topping onto the dough from the center out in a spiral path. Stop pipping until you have 1-2 rounds out of the dough edge.
Bake in the preheated oven at 180 degrees Celcius for about 18-20' minutes. 

Enjoy the bread when it's hot. You can store the bread in the fridge and preheat at 180 degrees Celcius for 5'
