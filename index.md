# Hi, I'm Trinh To

## 🏫 University of Washington Bothell 💻 Computer Science and Software Engineering

Being in such an unique time of the human history, learning, preparing for my career in Tech can be very difficult and challenging. But I’m very excited to learn more, get out of my comfort zone, and enjoy the process. I believe the harder it gets, the more I learn.

### Organization

I worked for Foundation for Success for over a year during my time in Green River College. The journey I have with FFS was full of joy and I growth a lot as a person.
